# MapReduce

MapReduce is a powerful programming model designed for processing large data sets across distributed computing environments. This repository contains an implementation of the MapReduce algorithm, providing a simplified yet robust approach to parallel data processing.

## Key Features
- **Distributed Processing**: Efficiently handles large-scale data processing across multiple computing nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatically manages node failures, ensuring reliable job completion.
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scales with the addition of new nodes to the computing cluster.

## How It Works
The MapReduce algorithm consists of two main phases:

### Map Phase
- Data input is divided into smaller segments.
- Each segment is processed independently to produce intermediate key-value pairs.

### Reduce Phase
- Intermediate key-value pairs generated in the Map phase are grouped by keys.
- The reducer aggregates these groups to produce the final output results.

## Implementation Details
- **Programming Language**: (Specify language, e.g., Python, Java, Hadoop)
- **Components**:
  - **Mapper**: Processes input data segments and outputs intermediate key-value pairs.
  - **Reducer**: Aggregates intermediate data and produces final results.
